# Bing Chat Clipboard Helper

Coding in Bingchat can be annoying in regard to the clipboard. This script provides 3 main features:

* Copy button added to codeblocks
* Multi-copy inputs - Use the inputs to copy more codeblocks at once.
* Long paste helper - Clipboards over the character count will automatically adjust to the next section when pasting. 

All of this code, including the recursive shadowroot parser was built by Bing Chat with direction from me.
